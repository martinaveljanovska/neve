            <h2 class="container-title">What is Neve Yerushalayim?</h2>
            <p>Neve’s mission is to educate, empower, and inspire young Jewish women. Neve was
              founded in 1970 by Rabbi Dr. David Refson to give Jewish women a Torah education in
              a vibrant, open-minded atmosphere. Women who come to Neve might have a
              beginner’s knowledge of Judaism or wish to discover more about their Jewish identity.
              We also accept students who have an advanced education and want to deepen their
              understanding and become leaders. Neve gives the support needed to help women
              challenge the status quo and make independent choices. </p>
            <p><b style="font-weight: 600;">While Corona has created
                new obstacles to the world of Kiruv, Neve has fully instituted an initiative that provides
                both education and support to all of our alumnae as well as continuing our important
                outreach.</b></p>

          <div class="column">
            <h2 class="container-title">What is The Neve Family Institute?</h2>
            <p>The Neve Family Institute, located in Har Nof, Jerusalem is a grassroots therapeutic
              center that has been serving the greater Jerusalem area for nearly 19 years by offering
              low-cost therapy to the local populace, many coming from the country’s poorest
              segment of the population, empowering families, children and women to lead selfsufficient lives. Services
              are
              multi-faceted including individual and group therapy for
              post trauma, domestic abuse, marital challenges, various disabilities and selfsufficiency. One of the
              major
              divisions within the Family Institute is the Children’s
              Center whose goal is to help children suffering from various crises and challenges,
              necessitating the addition of a Post-Traumatic department. A specially-trained domestic
              violence treatment team provides counseling, support, and preventive services for men
              and women who have experienced or are in relationships involving physical, sexual or
              psychological abuse.
            </p>
            <p><b style="font-weight: 600;"> During the current Corona Pandemic, these life saving services
                are needed more than ever!</b></p>

              <h3>What is Neve Yerushalayim?</h3>
              <p>Neve’s mission is to educate, empower, and inspire young Jewish women. Neve was founded in 1970 by
                Rabbi Dr. David Refson to give Jewish women a Torah education in a vibrant, open-minded atmosphere.
                Women who come to Neve might have a beginner’s knowledge of Judaism or wish to discover more about their
                Jewish identity. We also accept students who have an advanced education and want to deepen their
                understanding and become leaders. Neve gives the support needed to help women challenge the status quo
                and make independent choices. While Corona has created new obstacles to the world of Kiruv, Neve has
                fully instituted an initiative that provides both education and support to all of our alumnae as well as
                continuing our important outreach.</a></p>

              <h3>What is The Neve Family Institute?</h3>
              <p>The Neve Family Institute, located in Har Nof, Jerusalem is a grassroots therapeutic center that has
                been serving the greater Jerusalem area for nearly 19 years by offering low-cost therapy to the local
                populace, many coming from the country’s poorest segment of the population, empowering families,
                children and women to lead self-sufficient lives. Services are multi-faceted including individual and
                group therapy for post trauma, domestic abuse, marital challenges, various disabilities and
                self-sufficiency. One of the major divisions within the Family Institute is the Children’s Center whose
                goal is to help children suffering from various crises and challenges, necessitating the addition of a
                Post-Traumatic department. A specially-trained domestic violence treatment team provides counseling,
                support, and preventive services for men and women who have experienced or are in relationships
                involving physical, sexual or psychological abuse. During the current Corona Pandemic, these life saving
                services are
                needed more than ever!
